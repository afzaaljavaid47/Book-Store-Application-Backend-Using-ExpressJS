# Book Store Application Backend Using ExpressJS

## Abstract

This project is the backend for a book store application developed using ExpressJS. It provides a RESTful API for managing book data, user authentication, and order processing. The backend is designed to handle various operations such as creating, reading, updating, and deleting books, as well as managing user accounts and orders. The primary objective of this project is to provide a robust and scalable server-side solution for an online book store.

## Introduction

The Book Store Application Backend is designed to serve as the server-side component for an online book store. Built with ExpressJS, a fast and minimalist web framework for Node.js, this project demonstrates the use of server-side JavaScript to handle API requests and database operations. The backend connects to a database to store book information, user data, and order details. This project highlights essential server-side development practices such as routing, middleware usage, database interactions, and authentication.

### Features

- RESTful API for managing books, users, and orders.
- User authentication and authorization using JWT.
- CRUD operations for books and users.
- Order management including creation, update, and retrieval.
- Middleware for error handling and logging.
- Secure API endpoints with proper validation.

## Tools and Techniques

This project utilizes several tools and techniques to build a robust and efficient backend for the book store application:

- **ExpressJS**: A web framework for Node.js that simplifies server-side development.
- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime that allows for server-side execution of JavaScript.
- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database for storing book, user, and order data.
- **Mongoose**: An ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB and Node.js.
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: For user authentication and secure API endpoints.
- **Express Middleware**: For handling requests, errors, and logging.
- **dotenv**: For managing environment variables.
- **body-parser**: For parsing incoming request bodies in a middleware.
- **bcrypt**: For hashing user passwords.
- **Mocha and Chai**: For testing the API endpoints.
- **ESLint and Prettier**: Tools for maintaining code quality and formatting.
- **Git and GitHub**: Version control and collaboration platform.

By combining these tools and techniques, the Book Store Application Backend provides a comprehensive and practical approach to building a scalable and secure server-side application.
